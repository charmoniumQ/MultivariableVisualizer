# MultivariableVisualizer
This is my final project for my highschool Multivariable Calculus class. It has been  great class so far. I hope this project only makes it better.

## The project
The project is to create software that can be used to visualize functions of multiple variables. This will supply the teacher with visualizations that will make the lesson easier to understand. Multivariable calculus has many concepts that are difficult to visualize. Hopefully this will help.

The project is divided up into a folder for source code, the LaTeX report, and a few exhibit screenshots.
